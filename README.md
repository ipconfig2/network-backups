# Network Backups Repository

This repository serves as the storage location for automated network device backups generated by the [net-backup](https://github.com/ipconfig2/net-backup) project.

## Purpose

This repository is automatically updated by Ansible playbooks that collect and store device configurations and operational data from network infrastructure. It functions as a version-controlled backup storage system, providing:

- **Current backups**: The `current` folder contains the latest configuration and show command outputs for each network device
- **Archive by date**: The `archive` folder stores historical backups organized by date
- **Version control**: All changes are tracked through Git commit history

## File Naming Convention

The files follow a consistent naming pattern:
- `[vendor]_[device_type][number]-config.txt`: Device configuration files
- `[vendor]_[device_type][number]-showoutput.txt`: Output from various show commands

## Automation Integration

This repository is an extension of the net-backup project. The backup files are automatically:
- Generated by Ansible playbooks
- Stored in the `current` folder for the latest backups
- Archived by date in the `archive` folder
- Committed with meaningful commit messages
- Pushed to this repository for version control

For information about the backup automation process, please visit the [main project repository]([https://github.com/ipconfig2/net-backup]).

## Usage

While this repository primarily serves as an automated storage location, its contents can be valuable for:

- Recovering previous configurations
- Auditing network changes
- Reviewing historical device states
- Comparing configurations across time

## Note

This repository is intended to be managed by automated processes. Manual changes to files in this repository are not recommended as they may be overwritten by the next automated backup process.
